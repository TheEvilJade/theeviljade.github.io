                    <img class="responsive_images" id="disorders_img" src="/images/mental-disorders.png" alt="Mental disorders">
                    <p>Occasional anxiety is an expected part of life. You might feel anxious when faced with a problem at work, before taking 
                        a test, or before making an important decision. But anxiety disorders involve more than temporary worry or fear. For a 
                        person with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere 
                        with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.</p>
                    <h2 id="panic">Panic Disorder</h2>
                        <p>Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder. It causes panic attacks, which are sudden feelings of terror for no reason.</p>
                        <p>Panic attacks can happen anytime, anywhere and without warning. You may live in fear of another attack and may avoid 
                            places where you have had an attack. For some people, fear takes over their lives and they cannot leave their homes.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes it starts when a person is under a lot of stress. Most people get better with treatment. Therapy can show 
                            you how to recognize and change your thinking patterns before they lead to panic. Medicines can also help.</p>
                        <p>Some of the <strong>symptoms</strong> are fast heartbeat, chest pain, breathing difficulty, dizziness.</p>
                    <h2 id="phobias">Phobias</h2>
                        <p>A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder. It is a strong, irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual 
                            danger. There are many specific phobias. Acrophobia is a fear of heights. You may be able to ski the world's tallest 
                            mountains but be unable to go above the 5th floor of an office building. Agoraphobia is a fear of public places, and 
                            claustrophobia is a fear of closed-in places. If you become anxious and extremely self-conscious in everyday social 
                            situations, you could have a social phobia. Other common phobias involve tunnels, highway driving, water, flying, 
                            animals and blood.</p>
                        <p>Some of the <strong>symptoms</strong> are panic and fear, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, trembling, a  strong 
                            desire to get away.</p>
                    <h2 id="ocd">Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</h2>
                        <p>If you have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), you have repeated, upsetting thoughts called obsessions. You do the 
                            same thing over and over again to try to make the thoughts go away. Those repeated actions are called compulsions.</p>
                        <p>Examples of obsessions are a fear of germs or a fear of being hurt. Compulsions include washing your hands, counting, 
                            checking on things or cleaning. Untreated, OCD can take over your life.</p>
                        <p>Researchers think brain circuits may not work properly in people who have OCD. It tends to run in families. The 
                            symptoms often begin in children or teens. Treatments that combine medicines and therapy are often effective.</p>

                <h1 id="children">Behavioral Disorder in Children</h1>
                    <p>Behavioral disorders involve a pattern of disruptive behaviors in children that last for at least 6 months and cause 
                        problems in school, at home and in social situations. Behavioral disorders involve a pattern of disruptive behaviors 
                        in children that last for at least 6 months and cause problems in school, at home and in social situations.Nearly 
                        everyone shows some of these behaviors at times, but behavior disorders are more serious.</p>
                    <p>Behavioral disorders may involve inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, defiant behavior, drug use and criminal activity.</p>
                    <p>There are several types of behavioral disorders, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</li>
                        <li>Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)</li>
                        <li>Conduct Disorder</li>
                    </ul>

                <h1 id="eating">Eating Disorder</h1>
                    <img class="responsive_images" id="eating_img" src="/images/eating.jpg" alt="Eating Disorder">
                    <p>Eating disorders involve extreme emotions, attitudes, and behaviors involving weight and food.</p>
                    <h2 id="anorexia">Anorexia Nervosa</h2>
                        <p>Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that makes people lose more weight than is considered healthy for their age 
                            and height. Persons with this disorder may have an intense fear of weight gain, even when they are underweight. 
                            They may diet or exercise too much, or use other methods to lose weight.</p>
                    <h2 id="binge">Binge Eating</h2>
                        <p>Binge eating is when a person eats a much larger amount of food in a shorter period of time than he or she normally 
                            would. During binge eating, the person also feels a loss of control.</p>
                        <p>Binge eating may occur on its own or with another eating disorder, such as bulimia, and usually leads to becoming 
                            overweight. People with bulimia typically eat large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. After binge 
                            eating, they often force themselves to vomit or take laxatives.</p>
                    <h2 id="bulimia">Bulimia</h2>
                        <p>Bulimia is an illness in which a person binges on food or has regular episodes of overeating and feels a loss of 
                            control. The person then uses different methods—such as vomiting or abusing laxatives—to prevent weight gain. Many 
                            (but not all) people with bulimia also have anorexia nervosa.</p>

                <h1 id="substances">Mental Health and Substance Use Co-Occurring Disorder</h1>
                    <p>Mental health problems and substance use disorders sometimes occur together.</p>
                    <p>This is because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Certain illegal drugs can cause people with an addiction to experience one or more symptoms of a mental health problem</li>
                        <li>Mental health problems can sometimes lead to alcohol or drug use, as some people with a mental health problem may 
                            misuse these substances as a form of self-medication</li>
                        <li>Mental and substance use disorders share some underlying causes, including changes in brain composition, genetic 
                            vulnerabilities, and early exposure to stress or trauma</li>
                    </ul>

                <h1 id="mood">Mood Disorder</h1>
                    <img class="responsive_images" id="depression_img" src="/images/depression.jpg" alt="Depression">
                    <p>These disorders, also called affective disorders, may involve feeling sad all the time, losing interest in important 
                        parts of life, fluctuating between extreme happiness and extreme sadness.</p>
                    <h2 id="depression">Depression</h2>
                        <p>Depression is a serious medical illness that involves the brain. It's more than just a feeling of being "down in the 
                            dumps" or "blue" for a few days.</p>
                        <p>Depression is a disorder of the brain. There are a variety of causes, including genetic, environmental, psychological, 
                            and biochemical factors. Depression usually starts between the ages of 15 and 30.</p>
                        <p>Some people get seasonal affective disorder in the winter. Depression is one part of bipolar disorder.</p>
                        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> can include sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, change in 
                            weight, difficulty sleeping or oversleeping, energy loss, feelings of worthlessness, thoughts of death or suicide.</p>
                    <h2 id="bipolar">Bipolar Disorder</h2>
                        <p>Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness. People who have it go through unusual mood changes. They go from very 
                            happy, "up," and active to very sad and hopeless, "down," and inactive, and then back again. They often have normal 
                            moods in between. The up feeling is called mania. The down feeling is depression.</p>
                        <p>The causes of bipolar disorder aren't always clear. It runs in families. Abnormal brain structure and function may 
                            also play a role.</p>
                        <p>Bipolar disorder often starts in a person's late teen or early adult years. But children and adults can have bipolar 
                            disorder too. The illness usually lasts a lifetime.</p>
                    <h2 id="sad">Seasonal Affective Disorder</h2>
                        <p>Some people experience a serious mood change during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. This 
                            condition is called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. SAD is a type of depression. It usually lifts during spring 
                            and summer.</p>

                <h1 id="personality">Personality Disorder</h1>
                    <p>People with personality disorders experience patterns of behavior, feelings, and thinking that can interfere with a 
                        person's life, create problems at work and school, cause issues in personal and social relationships.</p>
                    <h2 id="antisocial">Antisocial Personality Disorder</h2>
                        <p>Antisocial personality disorder is a mental health condition in which a person has a long-term pattern of manipulating, 
                            exploiting, or violating the rights of others. This behavior is often criminal.</p>
                    <h2 id="borderline">Borderline Personality Disorder</h2>
                        <p>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition in which a person has long-term patterns of unstable 
                            or turbulent emotions. These inner experiences often result in impulsive actions and chaotic relationships with other 
                            people.</p>

                <h1 id="psychotic">Psychotic Disorder</h1>
                    <img class="responsive_images" id="curse_img" src="/images/curse.jpg" alt="Curse">
                    <p>People with psychotic disorders lose contact with reality and experience a range of extreme symptoms that usually includes 
                        hallucinations—hearing or seeing things that are not real, such as voices, delusions—believing things that are not true.</p>
                    <p>However, these symptoms can occur in people with other health problems, including bipolar disorder, dementia, substance 
                        abuse disorders, or brain tumors.</p>
                    <h2 id="schizophrenia">Schizophrenia</h2>
                        <p>Schizophrenia is a severe, lifelong brain disorder. People who have it may hear voices, see things that aren't there 
                            or believe that others are reading or controlling their minds.</p>
                        <p>No one is sure what causes schizophrenia, but your genetic makeup and brain chemistry probably play a role.</p>
                        <p>Another types of psychotic disorder is <strong>schizoaffective disorder</strong>, symptoms of schizophrenia and a mood 
                            disorder such as depression and bipolar disorder.</p>
                        <p><strong>Delusional disorder</strong> primarily affects thoughts and ideas. People with a delusional disorder are 
                            convinced that their ideas are real, despite evidence to the contrary.</p>
                        <p><strong>Brief psychotic disorder </strong>symptoms are the same as those of schizophrenia (delusions, hallucinations, 
                            disorganized speech and behaviour). However, they appear suddenly and are often triggered by major stressor, such as 
                            a death in the family, violence, illness or a natural disaster. A psychotic episode lasts no more than a month. 
                            Afterwards, people return to their normal level of function.</p>

                <h1 id="harm">Self-Harm</h1>
                    <p>Self-harm refers to a person's harming their own body on purpose. About 5% of people hurt themselves in this way. A person 
                        who self-harms usually does not mean to kill himself or herself. But they are at higher risk of attempting suicide if 
                        they do not get help.</p>
                    <p>Self-harm tends to begin in teen or early adult years. Some people may engage in self-harm a few times and then stop. 
                        Others engage in it more often and have trouble stopping.</p>
                    <p>Examples of self-harm include:</p>
                    <ul>

                <h1 id="ptsd">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h1>
                    <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a real illness. You can get PTSD after living through or seeing a traumatic event, 
                        such as war, a hurricane, rape, physical abuse or a bad accident. PTSD makes you feel stressed and afraid after the danger 
                        is over. It affects your life and the people around you.</p>
                    <p>PTSD starts at different times for different people. Signs of PTSD may start soon after a frightening event and then 
                        continue. Other people develop new or more severe signs months or even years later. PTSD can happen to anyone, even 
                        children.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> can cause problems like flashbacks, or feeling like the event is happening again, trouble 
                        sleeping or nightmares, feeling alone, angry outbursts, feeling worried, guilty or sad.</p>
