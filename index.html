            <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps 
                determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, 
                from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>
            <p>Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected. Many 
                factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry</li>
                    <li>Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse</li>
                    <li>Family history of mental health problems</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  For example, depression increases the risk for 
                many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, 
                the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.</p>

            <h2>What causes Mental Illness?</h2>
                <p>There is no single cause for mental illness. A number of factors can contribute to risk for mental illness, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse (for example, child abuse, sexual assault, 
                            witnessing violence, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes</li>
                        <li>Biological factors or chemical imbalances in the brain</li>
                        <li>Use of alcohol or drugs</li>
                        <li>Having feelings of loneliness or isolation</li>
                    </ul>

            <h1 id="maf">Mental Health Myths and Facts</h1>
                <h4>Myth: Mental health problems don't affect me.</h4>
                <p>Mental health problems are actually very common. In fact currently, 450 million people are experiencing such conditions. 
                    As the WHO explain, mental disorders are “among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.”</p>
                <h4>Myth: People with mental health problems are violent and unpredictable.</h4>
                
                <p>This, of course, is a myth. Thankfully, as the world becomes more aware of mental health conditions, this misconception 
                    is slowly dying away. Even individuals who are experiencing the most serious conditions, such as schizophrenia, are mostly 
                    nonviolent.</p>
                <h4>Myth: People with mental health needs, even those who are managing their mental illness, cannot tolerate the stress of 
                    holding down a job.</h4>
                <p>This is entirely false. It is true that someone living with a particularly severe mental health condition might be unable 
                    to carry out regular work. However, the majority of people with mental health issues can be as productive as individuals 
                    without mental health disorders.</p>
                <img class="responsive_images" id="accept_img" src="/images/acceptance.jpg" alt="Accept how you feel then move through it">
                <h4>Myth: Personality weakness or character flaws cause mental health problems. People with mental health problems can snap out 
                    of it if they try hard enough.</h4>
                <p>This is no more true than saying that a broken leg is a sign of weakness. Mental health disorders are illnesses, not signs 
                    of poor character. Similarly, people with, for instance, depression, cannot “snap out of it” any more than someone with 
                    diabetes or psoriasis can immediately recover from their condition.</p>
                <p>If anything, the opposite is true: Fighting a mental health condition takes a great deal of strength.</p>
                <h4>Myth: Therapy and self-help are a waste of time.</h4>
                <p>Many people don't acknowledge that taking breaks is necessary for us to perform at our best, no matter what we are working
                    on. And even fewer people are intentional as to the when, why, and how of taking breaks. Some people don't ask for help, 
                    because they would be ashamed of showing that they needed it.</p>
                <h4>Myth: There is no cure for mental health issues.</h4>
                <p>Those suffering from mental health conditions can live fulfilling, happy lives with treatment and support.
                <p>Mental illness is not a life sentence; with therapy, medication, lifestyle changes or a mixture of all three, you can live 
                    a happy, fulfilling life with a mental health condition.</p>
                <p>Depending on your diagnosis and its causes, the most effective treatment option will vary; but rest assured, help is available.</p>

            <h1 id="recovery">Recovery Is Possible</h1>
                <img class="responsive_images" id="brain_img" src="/images/brain.jpg" alt="Colorful brain"> 
                <p>Most people with mental health problems can get better. Treatment and recovery are ongoing processes that happen over time. 
                    The first step is getting help.</p>
                <p>Recovery from mental disorders and/or substance abuse disorders is a process of change through which individuals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve their health and wellness</li>
                        <li>Live a self-directed life</li>
                        <li>Strive to achieve their full potential</li>
                    </ul>
            <h2>Four Dimensions of Recovery</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Health:</strong> Overcoming or managing one's disease(s) or symptoms and making informed, healthy choices that 
                        support physical and emotional well-being.</li>
                    <li><strong>Home:</strong> Have a stable and safe place to live.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Engage in meaningful daily activities, such as a job or school, volunteering, caring for your 
                        family, or being creative. Work for independence, income, and resources to participate in society.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community</strong> Build relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope.</li>
